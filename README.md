# OpenRepo
A hack to allow SourceTree to open github-windows:// links

## Usage
Run `openrepo.exe /register-github`. Then you should be able to open github-windows links like [the one for this repo](github-windows://openRepo/https://github.com/voltagex/OpenRepo) in SourceTree

## I need a favour
This would work a lot better, especially on Windows 10, if it was a signed executable. Codesigning certificates cost a fair bit.
